Online workshop on AI for space

## Overview
Space AI Forum gathers researchers and practitioners working on AI for satellites, planetary robotics, ground and flight segments, mission operations, and science data systems. The focus is practical exchange across algorithms, hardware, safety, and deployment.

## Call for Papers
We welcome short papers reporting research, negative results with lessons, systems notes, or position pieces.

### Topics
- Autonomy for flight and surface assets  
- On-board learning and inference on constrained hardware  
- Sensing, perception, tracking, and navigation  
- Verification, validation, testing, and runtime monitoring  
- Robustness to faults, radiation, and anomalies  
- Scheduling, planning, and resource management  
- Communications, compression, and federated methods  
- LLMs and agents for ops and ground tools  
- Data pipelines from lab to orbit and surface  
- Science applications in EO and planetary pipelines
- Mission science planning and data assimilation
- Ethics, safety, policy, and standards for AI in space
