Remote workshop on AI for space systems and operations

## Overview
Space AI Forum brings together researchers and practitioners working on artificial intelligence for satellites, planetary robotics, ground segments, and mission operations. The aim is a practical exchange across algorithms, hardware, safety, and deployment.

## Call for Papers
We welcome short papers reporting research, negative results with lessons, systems notes, or position pieces.

### Topics
- Autonomy for flight and surface assets  
- On-board learning and inference on constrained hardware  
- Sensing, perception, tracking, and navigation  
- Verification, validation, testing, and runtime monitoring  
- Robustness to faults, radiation, and anomalies  
- Scheduling, planning, and resource management  
- Communications, compression, and federated methods  
- LLMs and agents for ops and ground tools  
- Data pipelines from lab to orbit and surface  
- Ethics, safety, policy, and standards for AI in space
